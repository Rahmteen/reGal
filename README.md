# Regal - Decentralized Auction Platform

_"An nft marketplace application that is built on a decentralized framework for handling all auction functionality. Regal is built on the ERC721 standard and safely mints non-fungible tokens. NFT's on the platform maintain their qualities by referencing IPFS URIs that are immutable. Development is always in progress and we'll be exploring this ecosystem to it's fullest potential."_. 

<br/>

## Dependencies/Apps: 

- [MongoDB Compass Desktop GUI](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass)
- [Metamask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn)
- Install the ganache-cli globally 
   * `npm i -g ganache-cli`

<br/>

## Usage
### GETTING STARTED

- `npm install` & `cd client npm install` (install dev/prod dependencies)
- `ganache-cli -p 9546` (set up custom port that truffle will connect to)
- delete the contracts for __in the build folder__ (not the one in client)
- `truffle console --network regal` (connect to the ganache server on 9546)
- `npm start` (run this from top level not the client)
